     *    <li>NEW: Auto-discovered but not yet imported into the inventory.</li> 
     *    
     *    <li>IGNORED: Auto-discovered but explicitly moved to a state that will suppress it from showing up in future 
     *                 discoveries.  Resources in this state will not be shown in the inventory browser.</li>
     *                 
     *    <li>COMMITTED: Resources in this state will be visible in the inventory browser.  The act of importing
     *                   resources changes their state from NEW to COMMITTED.  Note: resources that are factory-created
     *                   or manually added will also appear in the inventory browser and, thus, will be COMMITTED.</li>
     *                   
     *    <li>DELETED: Resources can be removed from the remote box, which will flip their status to DELETED to suppress
     *                 them from showing up in the inventory browser.</li>
     *                 
     *    <li>UNINVENTORIED: Resources can be removed from the inventory.  Since this is an expensive operation, these
     *                       resources are temporarily marked as UNINVENTORIED which will suppress them from showing up
     *                       in the inventory browser.  Then, in the background, all history will be purged for these
     *                       resources, after which they are removed from the database completely.</li>
